* [can-xdp-starter](./can-xdp-starter/): a toy example to show how to use an eBPF program with the XDP hook
* [can-tc-starter](./can-tc-starter): a sample program how to attach eBPF to the traffic control 
* [can-xdp-filter](./can-xdp-filter/): eBPF program to filter CAN frames on XDP
* can-gw2: we can't use eBPF to do a bpf\_redict, because the Kernel expect a L2 frame. TODO?
